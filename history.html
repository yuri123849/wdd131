                        <h2>Foundation by General Choi Hong Hi</h2>
                        <p>The International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) was founded on March 22, 1966, in Seoul, South Korea, by General Choi Hong Hi, who is widely considered the father of modern Taekwondo. General Choi, born in 1918, developed Taekwon-Do (ITF spelling uses a hyphen) by combining elements of Taekkyeon (traditional Korean kicking art) and Karate, which he studied during the Japanese occupation.</p>
                        <p>As a general in the South Korean military, he had the authority and resources to develop and promote his martial art systematically. His vision was to create a uniquely Korean martial art that could be practiced by anyone, regardless of age or physical ability.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>The Original 24 Patterns</h2>
                        <p>General Choi created 24 patterns (tul or hyung) representing 24 hours in a day, symbolizing a lifetime of Taekwon-Do practice. Each pattern is named after important figures or events in Korean history, such as patriots, scholars, and significant historical events.</p>
                        <p>The patterns were designed to teach fundamental movements, develop muscle memory, and honor Korean heritage. They progress in difficulty from Chon-Ji (Heaven and Earth) for white belts to Tong-Il (Unification) for black belts, with each pattern containing specific philosophical and historical meanings that connect practitioners to Korean culture.</p>

                        <h2>Political Tensions and Relocation</h2>
                        <p>Due to political tensions in South Korea during the 1970s, particularly conflicts with the Korean government and rival martial arts organizations, General Choi relocated the ITF headquarters to Toronto, Canada, in 1972. This move was controversial but allowed the ITF to operate independently from Korean government influence.</p>
                        <p>The decision reflected deeper political divisions in Korea and the martial arts community, creating a permanent split between the ITF and what would become the WTF (now World Taekwondo). This division still affects the Taekwondo world today, with different organizations following different technical standards and competitive rules.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Technical Characteristics</h2>
                        <p>ITF Taekwon-Do emphasizes sine wave motion—a distinctive up-and-down movement that generates power through the rise and fall of the body's center of mass. This biomechanical principle is unique to ITF and distinguishes it from other martial arts styles.</p>
                        <p>Techniques focus on realistic self-defense applications with hand strikes (punches, knife-hands, and ridge-hands) being equally important as kicks. Sparring uses continuous semi-contact rules with protective gear. The ITF maintains traditional uniform designs with V-neck doboks (uniforms) and focuses on patterns as the core of technical development rather than Olympic sport competition.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Global Spread and Military Influence</h2>
                        <p>The ITF spread rapidly through military channels, as General Choi's military connections facilitated the teaching of Taekwon-Do to armed forces worldwide. ITF instructors were sent to Vietnam, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas as part of Korean military and cultural diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>By the 1980s, ITF Taekwon-Do had established strong footholds in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and North Korea, where General Choi maintained relationships despite Cold War tensions. This military foundation gave ITF a disciplined, martial focus distinct from sport-oriented styles.</p>

                        <h2>Divisions and Legacy</h2>
                        <p>After General Choi's death in 2002, the ITF split into three main factions due to disputes over leadership and direction: ITF-Vienna (based in Austria), ITF-North Korea, and ITF-Canada. These divisions weakened the organization's global influence but also demonstrated the passion of practitioners dedicated to preserving General Choi's legacy.</p>
                        <p>Various reunification efforts have occurred, with some success in recent years. Despite organizational challenges, ITF Taekwon-Do maintains millions of practitioners worldwide who value its traditional approach, self-defense emphasis, sine wave technique, and connection to the art's original roots under General Choi Hong Hi.</p>

                        <h2>Foundation by Grand Master Park Jung Tae</h2>
                        <p>The Global Taekwon-Do Federation (GTF) was founded in 1990 by Grand Master Park Jung Tae, one of General Choi Hong Hi's most senior students and technical innovators. Master Park, who held an 8th dan black belt under General Choi, had been instrumental in developing much of the ITF's technical curriculum and pattern system.</p>
                        <p>However, philosophical and technical disagreements with General Choi led Master Park to establish his own organization that would refine and evolve Taekwon-Do techniques while maintaining respect for traditional roots. His vision was to apply modern sports science and biomechanics to traditional techniques.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Technical Evolution and Innovation</h2>
                        <p>Master Park Jung Tae introduced significant technical refinements to traditional ITF Taekwon-Do. The most notable innovation was the elimination of sine wave motion in favor of 'hip twist' technique, which GTF practitioners believe generates more practical power and is biomechanically superior.</p>
                        <p>GTF patterns maintain the same names and sequences as ITF patterns but are executed with different body mechanics. The organization emphasizes scientific principles of motion, physics, and anatomy to optimize technique efficiency and reduce injury risk during training. This scientific approach attracted practitioners interested in evidence-based martial arts training.</p>
                    </div>

                        <span class="timeline-date">1990s</span><br>
                        <h2>Philosophy: Tradition Meets Science</h2>
                        <p>The GTF philosophy balances respect for Taekwon-Do's Korean heritage with modern sports science and practical application. While maintaining the traditional five tenets (Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-Control, and Indomitable Spirit), the GTF incorporates contemporary training methods, sports psychology, and injury prevention research.</p>
                        <p>Master Park believed that martial arts must evolve with scientific understanding while never losing sight of character development and moral education as the ultimate goals of training. This progressive yet respectful approach differentiated GTF from more conservative traditional organizations.</p>
                    </div>

                        <span class="timeline-date">1990s - 2000s</span><br>
                        <h2>Global Expansion Strategy</h2>
                        <p>Unlike the ITF's military-focused expansion, the GTF pursued a grassroots approach, establishing training centers through dedicated instructors who emphasized quality over quantity. The organization spread rapidly through Europe, particularly Germany and Austria, before expanding to the Americas, Asia, and Australia.</p>
                        <p>GTF prioritized instructor education, establishing comprehensive certification programs and requiring regular technical updates. This systematic approach created a more unified technical standard across different countries than many other Taekwon-Do organizations achieved. Seminars and international training camps became central to maintaining technical consistency.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Competition and Sport Development</h2>
                        <p>The GTF developed its own competition rules that differ from both ITF and WT (World Taekwondo) formats. GTF tournaments emphasize controlled continuous sparring with point-stop action for clear techniques. The scoring system rewards technical precision and proper form over aggressive volume of attacks.</p>
                        <p>Pattern competitions judge not just memorization but also understanding of applications, power generation, and rhythmic flow. This approach aims to maintain martial arts integrity while providing competitive opportunities for practitioners of all ages and skill levels, from children to senior citizens.</p>

                        <h2>Master Park's Legacy</h2>
                        <p>Grand Master Park Jung Tae passed away in 2002, the same year as General Choi Hong Hi, marking the end of an era for Taekwon-Do's founding generation. Despite his passing, Master Park left a detailed technical curriculum, instructional videos, and a corps of highly qualified instructors to carry on his vision.</p>
                        <p>His emphasis on technical precision, scientific training methods, and systematic instructor development became the foundation for the GTF's continued growth. Master Park's students continue to spread his teachings, ensuring that his innovations in Taekwon-Do technique and pedagogy remain influential in the martial arts world.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>GTF in the 21st Century</h2>
                        <p>Today, the GTF operates in over 40 countries with hundreds of thousands of practitioners. The organization maintains strict quality control through regular international seminars, instructor certifications, and technical examinations. Leadership under Master Park's successors has maintained his vision while adapting to modern challenges.</p>
                        <p>GTF has embraced modern technology, offering online training resources, video analysis tools, and virtual seminars while maintaining traditional dojang (training hall) culture. The federation continues to attract students who appreciate its scientific approach to technique, high technical standards, and balanced emphasis on sport, self-defense, and personal development. The GTF remains committed to Master Park's vision of evolving Taekwon-Do while respecting its roots.</p>
